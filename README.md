# SOC Home Lab Project

## üìå Overview
This project is a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab** designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity operations.  
It integrates **SIEM, Threat Emulation, and Incident Response platforms** to detect, analyze, and respond to security events in a controlled environment.  

The lab helps me (and others) to practice **threat detection, incident response, and SOC workflows** with open-source tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components
- **SIEM & Monitoring**  
  - [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) ‚Äì Host-based intrusion detection and log analysis  
  - [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/) ‚Äì Centralized log storage, search, and dashboards  

- **Incident Response**  
  - [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/) ‚Äì Incident Response Platform (IRP)  
  - [Cortex](https://www.cortex-cert.fr/) ‚Äì Analyzer and responder engine integrated with TheHive  

- **Threat Emulation**  
  - [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) ‚Äì Adversary simulation framework (ATT&CK-based testing)  

- **Lab Environment**  
  - **Ubuntu Server** (Wazuh + Elastic + TheHive + Cortex)  
  - **MacBook (Victim Machine)** ‚Äì Target for Atomic Red Team simulation

## 1. Install VirtualBox
Step-by-step guide for installing **Oracle VirtualBox** on your host machine.

1. Go to the official VirtualBox website: [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
4. Once installation is complete, launch VirtualBox from your applications menu.

## 2. Download & Install Ubuntu Server
We will install **Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS** inside VirtualBox.  
Ubuntu Server will act as the main system for our SOC lab (Wazuh, Elastic Stack, TheHive, etc.).


### 2.1 Download Ubuntu Server ISO
1. Go to the official Ubuntu Server download page: [Ubuntu Server Downloads](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).  
2. Download the **24.04.3 LTS ISO** for your system.

### 2.2 Create a New Virtual Machine
1. Open **VirtualBox** ‚Üí Click **New**.  
2. Enter VM details:  
   - Name: `Ubuntu-SOC`  
   - Type: `Linux`  
   - Version: `Ubuntu (64-bit)` 
3. Choose the downloaded Ubuntu Server ISO.   
4. Allocate **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)  
5. Create a **Virtual Hard Disk**: 40GB minimum, VDI, dynamically allocated

### 2.3 Configure Network
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Network**.  
2. Configure adapters:  
   - **Adapter 1** ‚Üí `Bridged Adapter` (gets an IP from your local network)  
   - **Adapter 2** ‚Üí `Host-Only Adapter` (optional, for internal lab communication)  
3. Boot the VM and check IP:  
```bash
ip a
```

## 3. Configure Ubuntu Server
After successfully installing Ubuntu Server on VirtualBox, follow these steps to configure your server.


### 3.1 Update and Upgrade the System

Make sure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 3.2 Check Network Connectivity

Verify that your server is connected to the internet by pinging an external host

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 3.3 Set Hostname

Set a custom hostname for your server


```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ubuntu-soc
```

Verify the change

```bash
hostnamectl
```

### 3.4 Enable OpenSSH Server

Install and enable the OpenSSH server to allow remote connections

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Check status

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```
